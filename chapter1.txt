PROLOGUE: DEATH AND REINCARNATION

It was just your typical kind of life. I graduated from
college, landed a job at a sort-of-big general contractor
outfit, and with my older brother taking care of our parents
for me, I was currently enjoying all the myriad benefits of
the bachelor-pad life. Age thirty-seven. No significant other.

I wasn’t exactly short or frumpy or hideous or anything.
But when it came to the opposite sex, apparently I had
nothing to offer. I’d made efforts along those lines, with
varying degrees of dedication, but by the third rejection,
something fizzled out within me. Besides—really, at this
age, I was kinda past the point where a girlfriend needed to
be my main focus. Work kept me busy enough. Plus, it
wasn’t like I was gonna die without one.

…I’m not making excuses, all right? It’s just that I
started thinking…

“Oh, hello, sir! Sorry we’re late!”
There he was, walking toward me, bursting with all that
youthful energy of his. He and the beautiful woman next to
him. His name was Tamura, one of the guys who worked
under me, and she was Sawatari, the front-desk lady and
pretty much the “it” girl around the office.
These bums asked to see me because they were getting
married and wanted my advice. In other words, this
meeting was the whole reason I was brooding over why I
was such a failure at personal relationships. I was leaning
against a telephone pole at the intersection where we’d
agreed to meet after work, thinking to myself.

“Nah.” I nodded a greeting at Sawatari and asked,

“What’d you want to talk about?”

“Oh, good to meet you. My name’s Miho Sawatari. I’ve

seen you at work a lot, but…um, I guess this is the first

time I’ve spoken to you, huh? It makes me kind of nervous,

somehow.”
I’m the one who should be nervous, lady! my mind

griped to itself. It’s not like I’m any good at speaking to
women. How about a little sympathy here?

Any way you looked at it, I was the wrong person to ask.

I knew nothing about love. They were doing this just to

spite me—I was sure of it. Pretty sure, anyway.

“Oh, there’s nothing to be nervous about,” I replied.

“Satoru Mikami. It’s good to meet you, Ms. Sawatari…

although you’re famous enough around the office that you

hardly need to even introduce yourself, huh? Tamura and I

went to the same college, and we kinda hit it off during his

training period, so that’s how we know each other.”

“Famous? Oof! Not famous in a weird way, I hope?”

“Oh, y’know. I hear stories about you dating Kameyama

or messin’ around with Mr. Kihara in management…”

Somehow, I decided that picking on her would be a good

idea. I just meant it as a passing joke, but it made

Sawatari’s face turn a bright shade of red, her eyes

watering up a bit. It was cute, in a way. People were always

telling me to tone that stuff down—that I needed to

consider people’s feelings more or, if not that, at least make

it funnier—but I couldn’t help myself. So mark that down as
another failure. Maybe I really do have a crap personality.

Tamura took that chance to intervene, giving Sawatari a
pat on the shoulder. Dammit, Tamura! So blessed with the
natural charm you need to live a decent life… I wish people
like you would just explode!

“Aw, stop being mean to her,” he admonished with an

effortless smile. “And don’t worry, Miho, he’s just having a

little fun with you.”

Cool, refreshing, and completely guileless—Tamura was
impossible to hate. He was still just twenty-eight, quite a
bit younger than I was, but we got on well nonetheless. I
probably owed him at least a few congratulations…

“Hah, sorry,” I said, figuring there was no reason to let
my jealousy devour me. “I can’t help but needle people like
that sometimes. But no point standing here on the
sidewalk. Wanna get something to eat while we talk?”

“Aaaahhh!!”
Screams. Chaos. What is—What’s going on?!
“Move! I’ll kill you!!”
I turned around to find a man sprinting toward me, a
backpack in one hand and a kitchen knife in the other. I
could hear shrieking. He was coming my way. With a knife.
A knife? And at the other end of it…
“Tamuraaaa!”
The moment I shoved Tamura aside, I felt a burning pain
run across my back. My body balled up as it collapsed to
the ground, trying to withstand the shock. I couldn’t tell
what had happened. I wanted to move, but I couldn’t.
“Get the hell outta my way!” the man shouted as he ran
off. I watched him go and then checked to see how my
companions were. The suddenness of it all had reduced
Tamura to a stupor, but he was unhurt. That was good. But,
man, was my back burning. So hot. Beyond anything I’d
describe as pain.
What’s up with that? It’s too hot… Gimme a break.

Confirmed. Resist Heat…successfully acquired.

Did I… Did I just get stabbed?
So I’m gonna die from a stabbing? Holy crap…

Confirmed. Resist Piercing Weapon…successfully
acquired. Following up with Resist Melee Attack…

Successfully acquired.

“M-Mr. Mikami, you’re bleeding… You won’t stop
bleeding!”

I really didn’t need to hear that right now. Was that
Tamura? I thought I heard some kind of weird voice. If it
was Tamura, then so be it.

I’m bleeding? Well, duh. I’m only human. If you stab me,
I’ll probably bleed all over you, yes.

Damn, this was starting to hurt, though…

Confirmed. Cancel Pain…successfully acquired.

Um… Well, shit. All this pain and panic was starting to
screw around with my consciousness.

“T-Tamura… Shut up. It… It’s nothing big, all right? Quit
worrying…”

“Mr. Mikami, you’re… The blood…” Tamura tried to hold
me up, face drained of color and looking about ready to
break into sobs. So much for that bravado from two
minutes ago. I tried to see how Sawatari was doing, but my
vision was too fogged up to manage it.

Now the burning feeling on my back was starting to
fizzle out. Instead, an intense, frigid cold was attacking me
from head to toe. That… That’s probably bad… People die
once they bleed too much, don’t they?

Confirmed. Constructing a blood-free body… Successful.

Hey, what’re you talking about? I can’t hear you too
well…

I tried to speak. And failed.
Shit. I think this might really be it… Like, the pain and
the heat were pretty well gone by now. It was just cold.

Cold as hell. I felt as if I was gonna freeze in place.
Who knew dying could keep you so damn busy?

Confirmed. Resist Cold…successfully acquired. Combined
with the previously acquired Resist Heat, the skill has
progressed to Resist Temperature.

Just then, what remained of my increasingly oxygen-
deprived brain cells chanced upon a flash of brilliance.

Oh, craaaaap, the files on my hard drive!
I summoned up my remaining wells of strength, striving
to relay the final regret I had left in life.
“Tamuraaa! If… If anything bad happens to me…take my
computer, okay? Put it in the bathtub, turn it on, and just
fry everything on the disk for me, man…”

Confirmed. Electricity-based deletion of data… Cannot
execute. More information required. Substituting with Resist
Electricity… Successfully acquired.

It took a moment for my plea to register with Tamura.
He gave me a blank stare. Then he snickered.

“Ha-ha! That’s just like you, isn’t it?”
Even if it was just a snicker, it beat having to depart this
plane of existence with a grown man blubbering on top of
me. I’d take it.
“All I wanted was to show Sawatari off to you, too…,” he
continued.
“Pfft…”
Hah. I knew it. That bastard.
“It’s fine, okay? Make her a happy woman.”
I wrung out the last bit of strength my body had to offer.
“Just kill my PC for me…”

It was just your typical kind of life. I graduated from
college, landed a job at a sort-of-big general contractor
outfit, and with my older brother taking care of our parents
for me, I was currently enjoying all the myriad benefits of
the bachelor-pad life.

And I was a virgin.
Imagine that. Floating off to meet my maker in
completely unused condition… My manhood was probably
crying its single eye out right then. Sorry I couldn’t make
you a real grown-up. If there’s such a thing as
reincarnation, I’m gonna go on the attack next time—I
promise. I’ll hit up everyone I see, stalking my prey before I
go in for the kill… Okay, not like that, but…

Confirmed. Unique skill “Predator”…successfully
acquired.

I mean, here I was, lookin’ at forty without ever losing
my virginity. Like an old sage meditating in the mountains.
Another few years, and I probably could’ve been the great
sage of celibacy. Not the road I wanted to take in life, but
there you go.

Confirmed. Extra skill “Sage”…successfully acquired.
Evolving extra skill “Sage” into unique skill “Great Sage”…
Successful.

…Hey, someone mind telling me who’s talking? What do
you mean, “unique skill ‘Great Sage’”? Someone tryin’ to
start something with me? There’s nothing “unique” about
that! If you think I’m finding that funny, I’m not! That’s just
mean, man…

Before I could continue down that train of thought,
however, I fell asleep.

Weird how death’s nowhere near as lonely as I thought
it’d be.

That was the last thought I had on the mortal plane.





CHAPTER 1

MY FIRST FRIEND

It was dark. Too dark to see anything. Where was I? What
even happened, for that matter? Someone was picking on
me for being a celibate sage or something, and then…

That was enough to jump-start my mind again.
My name was Satoru Mikami. Just another thirty-seven-
year-old in a suit. And when I shoved my coworker aside on
the street, some random maniac stabbed me. Good. I
remembered all of that. Which meant I must be fine. No
need for panic. That wasn’t like me anyway. I was known
for having a cool head. The last time I panicked, it was
grade school and all I did was wet my pants, just a little bit.
I tried looking at my surroundings. Then I noticed—I
couldn’t open my eyes. Odd, I thought as I tried to rub
them and my arms didn’t respond. And more to the point,
Where’s my head, anyway?
This was getting confusing. Like, whoa. Wait a sec. I
needed some time to deal with this.
Whenever I start freaking out, I always find it helpful to
sit still and start counting prime numbers until I calm
down. Let’s try that. One, two, three—
Wait, one doesn’t count as a prime number, does it?
Ugh… Now wasn’t the time for this. I couldn’t let myself
think about this stupid crap. This was bad, wasn’t it? Like,
what’s going on, here?! Was I…like, past the point of no
return, unless I did something?
Panicking, I checked to see whether I was hurt

anywhere. I didn’t seem to be. Physically, I felt terrific. No

cold, no heat—perfectly comfortable. That, at least, came

as a relief. Now for my hands and legs… Oop. Not so hot

there. No response from any of my limbs. What’s up with

that? Getting stabbed in the back wouldn’t force the

doctors to amputate all my extremities, would it? I’d kind of

like those back.

Then there was the whole “can’t open my eyes” thing. I

was in a world of darkness, where I couldn’t see a thing. An

anxiety like none I’d ever felt before began welling up in

my mind.
Am I…in a coma or something?
I was conscious, certainly, but had I gotten detached

from my central nervous system, maybe?

Oh, man, anything but that! I mean, think about it. When

you throw a guy into a dark, enclosed space, it takes

practically no time at all for him to go insane. And that was

exactly where I was—and I couldn’t even die in peace any

longer, it looked like. If insanity was all that waited for me

here, that was enough to take the wind out of anybody’s

sails.
Just then, I felt something brush against my body. Hmm?

What’s that? I focused all of my senses on this unknown
sensation. It felt like grass against what might have been

the side of my stomach. Concentrating on the sensations, I

slowly began sussing out what was around me. I could feel

the pointy edges of some nearby leaves prick against my

body.

It made me a little happy, really. I was in total darkness a

moment ago, but now I had my sense of touch back, at

least. It made me so overjoyed that I made a beeline for the

grass, and—
Creep.
I could feel my body sliding flat against the ground. I… I

moved?!
This, at least, was clear evidence that I was not on any

kind of hospital bed. The feeling beneath my stomach (?)
took the form of hard, jagged rock. Hmm. It still didn’t
make much sense to me, but I appeared to be outdoors.

So I headed toward the grass, keeping my senses keen
against what I touched, although I still wasn’t quite clear
on where my head was. There was nothing to smell; I
wasn’t sure whether I had that sense or not.

Really, I had no idea what I was shaped like. I felt…
flowing. Jellylike. Kind of like a certain fantasy monster I
was well familiar with. In fact, the idea had been running
through my head for a while now.

…No. Come on. That’s just silly. Anything but that. I
decided to leave that anxiety-inducing prospect behind for
the time being and instead try out the final, untested one of
my five human senses. Not that I knew where my mouth
was. So…now what?

Suddenly, a voice ran across my mind.

Use unique skill “Predator”?
Yes
No

Huh? Wh-what? Unique skill “Predator”?
And what was up with that voice? I thought I heard
something weird when I was talking with Tamura earlier.
That wasn’t just me imagining things? Was someone there?
Something didn’t seem quite right with it. It wasn’t that I
thought I had a visitor, so much as…well, as I just had
words floating into my mind. Cold, unfeeling words, like a
computer-generated voice.

Let’s go with no for now.
No response. I waited a while for one, but no further
voices came. It appeared there wouldn’t be a second
question. Did I make the wrong choice? Was this the kind of

game where you got stuck if you didn’t start giving “yes”
answers? I was assuming the question would just repeat
forever until I said yes, like any normal RPG. Guess not.

Kind of rude of that voice, though. Showing up, asking a
simple question, then disappearing forever. It was nice
hearing someone for a change, but…the hell, man?

Oh well. Let’s go on with what I was trying before. My
sense of taste.

I moved toward the grass I felt earlier. As it brushed up
against me, I leaned forward, feeling the whole of my
weight settle over the field. It was definitely grass of some
sort.

Once I was sure of that, I suddenly realized that the area
where the plants met my body was starting to melt. I
thought it was myself melting at first, but apparently it was
only the grass. And with that, I could now tell that the
components of the plant life beneath me were being taken
into my body.

So that was how it worked? Instead of having a mouth to
eat with, I just ingested plant matter with my whole body?
It sure didn’t taste like anything.

From this, there were a few conclusions I could sensibly
make.

First, I was no longer human. That was a given by now.
So did I really get stabbed to death? It didn’t seem like
much of an open question at this point. It’d also explain
why I was resting on a rocky patch of grass instead of in a
hospital room.

What happened to Tamura? To Sawatari? Did he
scramble my hard drive for me, like he promised? I was full
of questions—but also a suspicion that, by this point, none
of them really mattered anymore. I had to think about what
came next.

So…is this it? Am I really a… You know… With the kind

of tactile feedback I’m getting at the moment…
I trained my senses back inside my body. It responded

with a rhythmic motion. Boing. Sproing. Slowly, inside the
total darkness, I took the time to ascertain the exact

boundaries of my form.

…Heavens! I used to be such a handsome, attractive
man, and now I’m so…fluid! So aerodynamic!

…Yeah, right! You think I’d accept this just like that?!

As far as I could feel, there was no longer any doubting

it. I could picture it in my mind.

I mean…what else could it be? Not like I had a prejudice

against it. Hell, it was kinda cute, if anything!
But was it for me, though? If you took a poll, I think at

least nine out of ten people would have the same answer.

I would just have to accept it, though. Accept the fact

that my “soul,” or whatever you want to call it, had been

reborn inside a monster from another world. The odds of

such a thing seemed astronomically low to me, but…





But I’d been reborn. As a slime.

Munch, munch.
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
I just snacked on some grass.
Why did I do that? Well, why not?
Not like I had anything else to do!

It had been a few days or so since I was pretty much
forced to accept the fact that I was now a slime. How many,
I wasn’t exactly clear on. The passage of time is tough to
pick up on when all you can see is total darkness.

One discovery I had stumbled upon over the past few
days was that a slime’s body could be way more useful than
at first sniff. I never got hungry, for one, nor did I get tired.
Food and sleep, for me, were wholly unnecessary. And I had
divined something else, too. I couldn’t be completely sure,
but there didn’t seem to be anything else living around
here. In terms of danger, I wasn’t sure there was any to
speak of. My days were blissfully free of worry.

Or anything else, really.
The whole time, I never heard that voice again. By this
point, I wouldn’t have minded a little companionship. But
no. It was just me, the grass, and me eating it for lack of
much else to do. It was simply a way to kill time. And by
this point, I could sense the entire process—my body
absorbing the blades, dismantling them internally, sorting
through all the components, and storing them away.
What it all meant, I couldn’t say. It was starting to
frighten me a bit. I needed to do something, or I’d lose my
mind. So I kept going through the cycle—absorb, break
down, store up. But there was something odd about the
process. Elimination never factored into it, somehow. Not

even once. Maybe slimes didn’t need to do that. Hell, not
like I’d know either way. But where was all this stuff I was
ingesting going, then? My senses told me that my form
hadn’t changed in any appreciable manner from when I
first arrived.

So what the hell?

Received. It is being stored in the stomach of the unique
skill “Predator.” Current physical space usage is less than
one percent.

What? Whoa! It speaks!
But since when was I using any skills? I thought I
answered no back there.

Received. The unique skill “Predator” is not being used.
The matter being ingested into your body is set to
automatically be stored in your stomach. This can be
changed as needed.

Oh? Well, nice to see we’re having a real back-and-forth,
finally. But back to business. If I use this skill, what
happens then?

Received. The unique skill “Predator” chiefly comprises
the following five effects:

Predation: Takes the target into your body. Lesser chance
of success if the target has its own
consciousness. Can be targeted on organic
and inorganic objects, as well as skills and
magic.

Analysis: Analyzes and researches targets taken into
your body. Lets you create craftable items. If
the required materials are present, allows you
to make a copy of the item. Successful
Analysis of the casting method allows you to
learn the target’s skills and magic.

Stomach: Stores the Predated target. Can also store
materials created via Analysis. Items stored in
your stomach are unaffected by time.

Mimicry: Reproduces the form and skills of absorbed
targets. Only available once the target has
been Analyzed.

Isolate: Stores harmful effects incapable of being
analyzed, neutralizing them and breaking
them down into magical force.

Um… What?
For the first time in a while, I was thrown. That sounded
like kind of an incredible ability. Not exactly the kind of
thing slimes were known for. At least not the ones I knew.
And…hang on. Who was this voice answering my
questions, anyway? Was someone there?

Received. This is the effect of the unique skill “Great
Sage.” The skill has taken effect, making it more
immediately available.

A sage, huh…? And here I thought that voice was just
screwing with me. Now it was the best partner I had. Hope
that keeps up.

Hell, anything would have been fine at that point. As

long as it helped smooth out the endless solitude I was

preparing myself for. For all I knew, this “voice” was
something my mind had crafted to keep my marbles intact.
It was fine by me. For the first time in ages, I could feel a
burden lifting from my heart.

By my count, it had been ninety days since I was
reincarnated as a slime.

To be more precise, ninety days, seven hours, thirty-four
minutes, and fifty-two seconds. How was I so sure about
this? Turned out that was one of the many side effects of
evoking that “Great Sage” skill.

Holy cats, was that thing helpful. Talk about your best
friend in a pinch. Any question that popped to mind, it
instantly provided the answer.

According to this Sage, it took ninety days for the skill to
fully fuse itself with my soul. Normally, it would be unable
to provide responses in the form of conversation, but in
order to answer my questions, it apparently revamped
itself, diverting part of its “World Language” powers to
assist me. That’s how it was explained to me, at least.

This useful ability—relaying words into my mind—isn’t
normally possible. As it explained to me, this “World
Language” was heard only when there were great changes
to the world or when you either earned or upgraded a skill
—something that normally didn’t happen all that often.
These skills were obtained only rarely, when the world
recognized that you had grown in one way or another.

Evolution, meanwhile, was something most people never
got to experience in their lives. It was all Greek to me, but
if that was how it was, I was willing to accept it.

So the Great Sage was answering my questions at the
moment, but otherwise it was this totally passive thing. No
real sentience or anything. Unless I spoke up, it would

never talk to me of its own volition. That was the only real
drawback, but tossing words around with someone again
was a wonderful feeling, even if it was a one-way street.

Although, back in my home world, having a conversation
with my own skill might have been considered strange…

So there I was, still locked in darkness, asking a barrage
of questions.

One thing the replies confirmed was that yes, I was a
slime now. I also found out why I never got hungry or
sleepy. The slimes in this world, it turned out, never had to
eat if they could keep absorbing the magic particles, or
“magicules,” in the air. In less magically abundant regions,
I would be obliged to fill up by absorbing monsters or small
creatures.

Most slimes shied away from areas with low magic
presences, but the ones that didn’t were apparently both
quite strong and madly vicious. Usually it was the other
way around, where a wealth of local magic meant
especially strong monsters.

In other words, the area I took up residence in was so
laden with magic that I didn’t even have to eat.

As for the sleep question:

Received. The body of a slime consists of a mass of
completely identical cells. Each individual cell may function
as a brain cell, a nerve cell, or a muscle cell. Since the
operational cells used for thought are rotated in and out at
regular intervals, there is no need for you to sleep.

This raised the question of where my memories were
being held, exactly. Maybe it was kind of like a RAID setup
on a computer?

That would be close enough, came the response.
Considering its lack of personality, the Sage certainly came

up with some snappy replies.
Speaking of which, the “Great Sage” skill consisted of

five effects:

Hasten Boosts perception speed by a thousand times.
Thought:

Analyze Analyzes and assesses the target.
and
Assess:

Parallel Operates on any matter you wish to analyze,
Operation: separating it from the regular thought

process.

Cast Annuls the casting period required when using

Cancel: magic, et cetera.

All of Provides full coverage of all unsuppressed

Creation: matter and phenomena in this world.

“All of Creation”? So I know about everything,
everywhere, with no effort on my part? Score! Or so I
thought.

It turned out that I could only be told information related

to things I’d already heard about—in other words, I needed

to recognize and understand a concept before I could grab

a full Analysis of it.

And the spell thing—did that mean I could instantly use
any magic once I learned it? And, like, there was magic in
this world and stuff?!

The Great Sage replied with a big Yes.
Well, once I knew that, I just had to try to learn a few

spells myself.

I checked with the Sage to see if it could help me cast
magic, but that was a no-go. Eh, it was worth a shot.

Still, I had another great idea: Could I link the
“Predator” Analysis skill with “Great Sage” Parallel
Operation?

Received. It is possible to link “Predator” Analysis with
“Great Sage” Parallel Operation. Do you wish to link them?

Yes
No

Uh, yeah? Not that I had anything to analyze yet… Wait.
Or did I? That grass in my stomach. The stuff I had been
eating to pass the time. What was that? Not like I had
anything else to do. Let’s give it a try.

Off you go, Sage.
………
……
…

Analysis complete.

Hipokute A type of ingredient used in healing medication.
herbs: Only thrives in areas blessed with high local

magic densities. Fusing its juice with magicules
produces recovery medicine. Grinding the
blades and fusing them with magicules
produces a salve that closes wounds.

Wow! That was what I’d been snacking on? Talk about an
unexpected windfall. I immediately set out to create some
medicine of my very own. The process took place inside my
body, so it didn’t really feel much like crafting, but the
Analysis took less than a second, and within another three-
ish, I had my very first potion. Five minutes, and I could’ve

had a hundred. And while I didn’t have anything else to
compare it to, using my Great Sage skills to assess them
resulted in a “high quality” rating.

So there you go. I was happy enough with it, at least. It
all went so fast, too. I asked the Sage about it, and it said
the process usually took more time than that. Linking it
with Parallel Operation must’ve been the right idea, I
suppose.

To test that theory out, I unlinked it long enough to
create a single potion. It took fifty minutes. Damn, that was
slow. Looks like I had the foresight to stumble across some
mega-compatible skills to combine. Not that I knew what I
was doing at all.

Some of your garden-variety weeds were also sprouting
here and there, but most of the local grasses were
hipokute. How ’bout that? So I decided, as a little
insurance, to Predate all the herbs I could in the area and
turn my stomach into a little recovery-potion factory. I
didn’t have much else to occupy my time. It was still pitch
black in here.

There was no doubt about it. I had put my guard down. I
had a partner who granted me skills and the ability to
engage in (kind of passive) conversation, and I let it get to
my head.

I suppose that had a lot to do with how for ninety days in
a row, I never ran into any other creatures. No danger to
my life whatsoever. But either way, I had let my guard
down.

For an instant, I was like, “Huh?”
I felt a sudden sensation that I had grown lighter or
heavier or, like…unstable.

Did I…fall in some water?

In the past ninety days, I hadn’t felt so much as a drop of
water hit my body. I’d assumed I was in a rain-free cave or
some other kind of shelter, so I had never even entertained
the possibility before.

I had probably slipped into a river or something. Rivers
don’t exist indoors, so maybe it was some kind of
underground creek in this cave I was in…? Up to now, I had
been careful with every step I took, making sure everything
remained steady in the darkness. But after learning about
my skills, getting full of myself, and using Predation to eat
a pasture’s worth of grass, I had stopped paying attention
to what was under me.

I was always like that. Getting cocky, then screwing it all
up in the end. I’d proclaim to a customer, “Oh, absolutely!
That won’t be any problem at all!” and then have hell to
pay. It had happened over and over. I still remember the
spiteful looks the rest of my team gave me for it.

Too bad I didn’t think to stop myself in time. What kind
of idiot runs off into parts unknown when they can’t even
see? If I survived this, I was gonna give myself what for. Of
course, given my personality, I doubted I’d learn anything
from it.

It was funny how serenely I was handling this whole
thing, though. Not like I had much in the form of arms or
legs I could flail about in horrified panic…

Guess it’s over, then. Pretty short lifetime—even by slime
standards, maybe. I said my final prayers, awaiting my
inevitable suffocation.

………
……
…
Suffocation never came.
Why not? Did I not fall in the water? Time to call on the
Sage, maybe.

Received. A slime’s body operates exclusively on
magicules. Oxygen is unnecessary, and therefore, so is
breathing. That is why you have not been engaging in that
behavior.

Oh… Right. I wasn’t paying attention, but I guess there
wasn’t any breathing, was there? Made sense. Even after
ninety days, I was still learning something new!

But now wasn’t the time to celebrate. I had fallen into
water, and even if I wouldn’t die, it did still put me in kind
of a bind. What now? I couldn’t really tell whether I was
floating or sinking. My lack of limbs precluded any attempt
at swimming. Would I wind up at the bottom sooner or later
and be able to creep my way back to the surface? Or was I
doomed to bob around in the middle of the current, never
reaching much of anywhere?

Though, if anything, it felt less like a violent torrent and
more like I was being rocked in a cradle. Very gently
rocked. It felt pretty good, even…

Something told me this wasn’t flowing water after all.
Maybe it was a lake, not a river. I didn’t feel as though I
was being taken anywhere. I was just kind of bobbing up
and down, like a plastic bag, and it didn’t feel as if I’d ever
hit bottom. If things stayed this way, I was in big trouble.

What now?
Just then, my brain cells—or my slime body, I guess—
came up with an ingenious plan. Maybe I could go all
Predator on this water and then spit it out for some water-
jet propulsion. Would that work? Only one way to find out.
Not like I could do anything else.
So I started drinking, filling my Predator stomach up to
approximately 10 percent of its capacity. Then, I expelled it
like I was wringing out my stomach.
The sense of release was exhilarating.
Suddenly, I heard a voice in my mind:

Water Pressure Propulsion skill acquired.

It was the first time I recognized it. This had to be the
so-called World Language. There was no mistaking it, since
the Sage spoke only when spoken to, but the two voices did
sound exactly the same.

But I didn’t have a moment to ponder over this. The
more pressure I applied on the water, the more pressure I
felt on myself, and I was rocketing forward at astonishing
speed, as if I was about to launch myself into the sky. The
acceleration was intense. Honestly, maybe it was a good
thing I couldn’t see. Instead, I just basked in the sensation
of my body zipping along through the darkness.

Well, let me clarify. If I could’ve seen my surroundings,
I’m sure the fear would’ve been intense…but not being able
to see was just as terrifying.

If you’ve ever been on a roller coaster in an amusement
park in total darkness, perhaps you’d understand the
feeling. My mind flashed back to my previous life and the
single day I spent visiting a certain paradise under the rule
of a certain rodent. At least his magical dreamland offered
safety harnesses.

By this point, I wanted to punch myself for coming up
with the idea. And trying it out right after thinking it up?
Come on, man! What happened to some kind of, you know,
preliminary safety check?

The terror was starting to affect my train of thought.
How long would I keep accelerating? How much water did I
spit out, anyway?

As that thought occurred to me, I felt my body crash
headlong into something and bounce off it. I braced myself
for a wave of paralyzing pain. Which never came.

Huh? Shouldn’t that have, like, damaged me? Or did it
damage me, and I just didn’t feel it or whatever?

Received. You have acquired Cancel Pain, which
interrupts the creation of pain. Your Resist Melee Attack has
reduced the amount of damage taken. The amount of
damage your body has incurred is ten percent. The intrinsic
slime skill Self-Regeneration has taken effect. Would you like
to support it with your Predator unique skill?

Yes
No

Oh, so I was hurt a little, then? Made sense. I wasn’t
sure whether this was a good or bad thing, but as long as I
knew something was up, then maybe I didn’t need to feel
pain after all. It’d make certain things easier.

Predator support, though, huh? I don’t really get it, but
sure. “Yes.”

At that moment, I was greeted with the feeling that I had
suddenly lost some of my body mass. After a while, I felt it
return. My damaged parts had been Predated, analyzed,
and repaired. Talk about a useful body to have. I should try
testing later to see how much of it I can afford to lose
before I’m KO’d. It was way too dangerous to mess with in
detail, but I guess I could afford to go without at least a bit
of it at a time, so…

Something told me I was getting a little too careful,
anyway. I had a stockpile of recovery potions, which I didn’t
even have to use. And I would’ve figured losing a tenth of
my body would be a pretty serious issue, but now I knew I
could just regenerate it in the space of ten seconds. Next
time I was damaged, I’d try using those potions.

So where am I, I wonder? Making sure my body was
back to normal, I checked out my surroundings. No telling
what kind of dangerous monsters might be nearby. I was
out of the water, but maybe there were scary, scaly things
waiting for me on the other side.

Slowly, carefully, I started taking action.
It kind of seemed as if whenever I did something
“carefully,” it meant I was about to be exposed to a heap of
danger. I was sure it was just my mind playing tricks on me,
though.
And that thought probably did me no favors, because…
Can you hear me, little one?
I heard something.

Little one? It’s probably not anyone besides me, is it?
It wasn’t a voice, exactly, but something I could

recognize more directly and instinctually in my mind. I
didn’t have any ears to listen with anyway.

Hello! You can hear me, can you not? Respond to me!
Well, no shit! But how was I supposed to reply without
any mouth? As an experiment, I tried thinking Shut up,
baldy! in my mind—not like this guy could hear it or
anything. But how was I gonna get anywhere here if I
couldn’t even give a—
…Oh-ho! You dare to call me bald, do you…? Rather a lot
of nerve packed into such a little body, no? I had hoped to
give my first guest in quite a while a little kindness, but it
would seem you are in rather a hurry to die!
Uh-oh. Geez, could’ve warned me that would work first.
And I had no idea who I was dealing with, either. Well, that
was it. My loss. Time for an apology.
I’m sorry! I didn’t know how to reply to you, so I just
tried saying the first thing that came to mind! I’m really
sorry about that! I can’t see anything right now, so I have
no idea what you even look like!
Did that come across? Kind of rude to call this guy bald
when I couldn’t even see him, I supposed. If he was, I’d
probably just pushed some very delicate buttons.

Heh-heh-heh… Eh-ha-ha. Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

The resulting laugh came in three distinct levels. A

masterpiece. So were we cool now, or—?
How fascinating. I had assumed you reacted as such

upon seeing me, but you cannot, eh? Most slimes are low-
level monsters, incapable of conscious thought as they run
through the cycle of absorption, division, and regeneration.
It is the rare one, indeed, that ever leaves its habitat.

Now what was he talking about? Was he more curious

than angry, then, or…? Either way, this was my first contact

with another intelligent being. The first conversation in my

new, oozy life. I wanted to keep it a friendly one.
You had aroused my curiosity, slime, by the way you so

eagerly slammed into my body. The regenerative powers
you just showed astonish me. Are you a named monster,
perhaps, or a unique?

A what? And a what? Say again? I’m sorry, I don’t get
what you mean. I’ve only been alive here for ninety days…

Hmm. I suppose, with your sentience, you were never
destined to be merely a slime. Named monsters are those
who have been assigned an exclusive name. But only ninety
days? Ridiculous. Are you a unique, then?

“Unique” meaning…?
A unique monster is an individual who has suddenly
attained unusual abilities, akin to mutation. They are
occasionally born in areas with high magical
concentrations… Perhaps you were born from the mass of
magicules that leaked out from me, then?

Muh? What the heck?

Let’s try using my previous-world knowledge to suss this

out. This guy (I’ll call him a guy for convenience’s sake) had

been leaking magic all over the local area. It was so thick,

in fact, that it gave birth to a monster. A slime. Me. Was

that it?
Hmm. No monster has ever come close to approaching

my domain in the past three hundred years. If you were

born from my magical force, then perhaps, indeed, that
gave you the power to touch me and live to tell the tale!

Oh… So you’re kind of, like, my dad, then?
No, not your parent by blood. I have no reproductive
ability to speak of. Some monsters do, and some do not, you
see.
Really? ’Cause I thought that kind of came with the
package by default. But if I just spontaneously burst out
from magic or whatever, maybe you don’t need it, huh?
…Your intellectual abilities surprise me. Very few,
indeed, are the monsters that possess anything of the sort.
Among all the monsters, only magic-born have sentience in
the way you or I would understand it.

The commentary went on for a while. But the most

important thing to learn from it was that apparently

humans existed in this world, too. Then there were

nonhumans, species very close to mankind in nature and

similarly gifted with reproductive abilities. These included

races like elves, hobbits, dwarves, and other fairy types,

and generally they were allied with the humans.

Alongside that, you had races like goblins, orcs,

lizardmen, and so on, which were hostile toward mankind

and treated like monsters as a result. This animosity wasn’t

inherent to their biology, however, so crossbreeding was

entirely possible.

Next were the “magic-born people”—the catchall term

for those who came into being from magic itself, monsters

who experienced sudden mutation, and sentient beings

evolved from animals or magical beasts. They had both

intelligence and reproductive ability, but only within their

own subspecies. In their upper social castes existed titans,

vampires, devils, and other longer-lived species—all equally

capable of having offspring, although they rarely did so,

since their overwhelming magic force caused them to be

nigh immortal, obviating the need to leave descendants.

These diverse intelligent, reproducing species were

hostile to mankind and collectively referred to as the

“magic-born race.” And reading between the lines, the

impression I got was that the magic-born weren’t so much

overtly hostile toward humans as the humans feared and

coveted their powers. It remained true, though, that both

sides were fighting for their own living spaces.

These sundry monsters had been classified by levels of

danger. The upper ranks of the magic-born were packed

with some pretty powerful buggers—all capable of leveling

a human town solo if they felt like it. Not the kinds of guys

you’d want to hang around.

So my new companion kept going for a while—about how

he’d fought against the upper-level magic-born in the past

and so on. Finally, the subject turned back to me.
As I told you, then, I lack the ability to produce offspring.

The reason is simple… Because I do not need to. I am of the
dragon race—one of only four in the world, both unique and
the most perfect of my kind. You will hereby know me as
Veldora, the Storm Dragon! My life span is infinite, my flesh
unfathomable! As long as my will remains intact, I shall be
ever alive! Ahhhhh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!

He could’ve skipped the laughter. I got it. So he didn’t

need to have kids, because he was gonna live forever,

right?

And while this guy took a while to get to the point, he did

mention something I didn’t want to overlook.

Veldora was the Storm…Dragon?

Plus, if he liked taking a good-natured swipe at upper-

level magic-born now and then, he was…like, pretty tough,

wasn’t he?

Using my knowledge of Earth stuff, I tried to picture

Veldora the Storm Dragon, no doubt seated in front of me

right now. I didn’t like what my mind came up with. He

seemed to be acting polite with me, and that made it all the

creepier.

So what now…?

W-wow, really? Well, thanks for all that handy guidance,
sir! Guess I better be on my way, then!

I tried my best to flee.
Halt. I have told you all about myself. It is your turn now,
would you not agree?
I probably shouldn’t have expected any other treatment.

Hmmmm. He wanted to know about me? If I told him about

my miraculous journey from an alien planet, would he

believe me? He seemed to marvel at how smart I was for a

slime—if I tried to make something up, I doubted he’d fall

for it. Such an attempt seemed like a good way to dig my

own grave.

Well, whatever. If he didn’t believe me, I’d deal with it

then. Summoning my resolve, I told Veldora everything that

had happened to me so far.

………

……

…
So… Yeah. Here I am, I guess! It’s been super rough,
y’know?
While prudently keeping the topic of my skills

unexplored, I regaled the dragon with my tale of being

stabbed, waking up as a slime, and everything else that

happened on the way to his domain.

It was a bit weird how…well, non-rough it all sounded

when I put it into words. But it was rough for me all the

same. And the worst part was how I was literally operating

blind the entire way. If some cute lady passed me on the

road later on, would I ever get to see her? The thought

saddened me a little.
Hmm. So a transmigrant, then? Your origins are quite

rare, indeed.
Huh? Are they? And you… “Transmigrant”? This isn’t

any big surprise to you?
What’s with that reaction? So these “transmigrants”

were common enough that he had a name for them? What

was so rare about it, then?
Hmph. You do see transmigrants, on occasion. Their

memories from the past are burned into their souls, due to
a powerful will. There are some, indeed, who retain every
memory of their past lives. But a transmigrant from
another world… That is quite uncommon. A regular soul, by
itself, would have no hope of surviving a journey across
realms. It would dissolve midway, taking its memories with
it. Someone retaining their full mind and becoming reborn
as a monster out of pure magic… I cannot recall any past
example of that. Quite…peculiar, indeed.

Transmigrants from other worlds, it seemed, kept only

part of their memories at best. Someone like me, who still

had them all, was pretty well unheard of—not that I cared

too much.

He had just told me something I couldn’t afford to

ignore. A soul, “by itself”…? So you could travel to this

world without getting reincarnated or anything?
Huh. Am I that unusual? ’Cause it sure doesn’t feel that

way… Are there people, then, who come here from other
worlds without being trans-whatevered?

There are. None have succeeded in traveling to another
world from here, but there are more than a few that have
completed their travels here from elsewhere. They are
known as “visitors,” or “otherworlders,” and they bear
knowledge of things that do not exist in this world. They
acquire, as I hear it, some manner of special power when
they make the journey here. Beyond that, there are records
of transmigrants, who—as I said—bear knowledge of other
worlds. Not all of them choose to openly identify
themselves as such, though, I imagine.

Interesting. I didn’t know whether they came from the

same planet I did, but it might be good to chat with them a

bit. There might even be some from Japan, for all I knew. It

was probably best for my sanity to have a goal while I was

here, besides.

I see, I see! In that case, I think I’ll try and track down
some of these “otherworlders,” as you called them. Maybe
I’ll find someone from my own land!

Well, one moment. You said you cannot see, yes?
Oh, uh, yeah. And? It was a pain in the ass, yes, but as

long as I took my time and kept from getting myself killed, I

was sure I’d run into some fellow visitors. Probably.
Let me help you see, then.

Um, what? Damn. This guy… I mean, Veldora the Storm

Dragon… He was acting way too nice to me, wasn’t he?

Could I really trust him?
Uh, really?
Indeed. On one condition, however. What do you say?

I didn’t like the sound of that, but…ah, what the hell.
What kind of condition?
A simple one. When I grant you the ability of sight, I beg
of you not to fear me. That, and I bid you come visit and
speak to me again. That is all. I trust my terms are
agreeable to you?

That’s all? Was he sure? What a lonely dragon. Guess

there was no one else around at the top. No wonder he

couldn’t stop talking to me—I must’ve been his first

conversational partner in ages.

If I’d had my druthers, I would have said this dragon was

a total pushover. He might’ve been feeding me a line this

whole time, even, saying he was a dragon. Maybe the

dragons in this world weren’t even all that powerful in the

first place.

Heh. This was a pretty good deal.
Is that really all you need?
Yes. To be honest with you, I was sealed away in here
three hundred years ago. Ever since then, I have had so
much free time on my hands, I was practically out of my
mind with boredom. What do you think?
Well, if that’s all you need, you got yourself a deal!
Good. It is a promise, then…and I trust you will hold up

your end of the bargain.
Of course! Maybe I don’t look it, but you can count on

me, man! Just ask anybody on Earth! They’ll vouch for me!

Hopefully he wouldn’t try to. That would be bad.

Very well. There is a skill known as Magic Sense. Can
you use it?

Oh, here we go again. More walls for me to deal with. So

unfair.

No, I can’t. What kind of skill is that?
It allows you to perceive the particles of magic floating
around you. It is not a very powerful skill, and all it offers is
a visual reference, so it is not difficult to acquire.
Oh… Sounds easy enough.
Indeed. I can wield it as easily as I can breathe. I hardly
even bother to think about it.
Really? So once I learn that, I’ll be able to see again?
Precisely. This world is covered in sheer magic, although
it is not spread evenly across its entire surface. Did you
know, also, that light and sound both have the properties of
a wave?
Yeah, I’ve heard about that. Light waves and sound
waves.
Ah. How intelligent of you. Did you learn of that in your
past world? You must have, I wager. But, indeed, you will
be able to observe how these waves disturb the nearby
particles of magic, then use that information to calculate
how the area around you looks and sounds. Simple, yes?
Um? Not really? What kind of BS was that? I, um, I’m not
really sure whether that sounds simple or not, actually…
No? But that is what allows one to continue fighting even
after losing both their sight and hearing! It protects you
from surprise attacks, and that is all but a requirement for
survival here, is it not?
Y-yeah, but…can we skip all that fighting talk and just
get me seeing again, maybe?
Mmm… Very well. Allow me to help you acquire this

skill, then. This is the only method I am aware of.
W-wait, can you do that? I’m kind of a newborn here…
Worry not. You do have your memories from your past

life, yes? And there, you gained knowledge about the
nature of light and sound. Without that, not even I could
help you, I wager. Luck is on your side, truly.

True. I supposed it would be hard to explain sight to

someone who can’t see at all. I certainly couldn’t manage

it. I read somewhere that Helen Keller learned how to

speak only by following cues she learned before going deaf

at age two. Maybe I could use my knowledge of Earth to

harness this “Magic Sense” thing to figure out what the

world around me was like…

Worth a shot, I guessed. This blindness was getting to be

a massive pain. Plus, I had the Sage on my side. It could

work this out.
I’m ready to learn, sir!
Now, now, no need for such ardor. It is quite simple.

First, try moving the magic around you with the force in
your body.

I had an inkling of what he meant. It was the skill I’d

probably adapted to blow myself out of the water a moment

ago.
Like this?

I tensed up, trying to imagine the strength circulating

through my body. I could feel something moving within—

the magicules my companion was talking about. I hadn’t

been conscious of it in the water, but it looked as though I

could adjust the force by how much I tensed up. Before, I

hadn’t been controlling the water so much as I was

controlling the magic dancing around in it. I was exercising

my magical muscles, and the particles around me were

reacting. It came to me surprisingly quickly.
Mmm. You are more gifted in this than I thought. Now,

do you see the difference between the magic moving within
you and that outside of your body?

Whoa. Maybe this actually was easy. Maybe I was more
sensitive to the magic I absorbed now that I was conscious
of the way I lived off it.

Well, sure! Like, that’s the stuff I’ve been eating all
along, right?

Heh-heh-heh! If you understand that much, the rest is
child’s play. All it takes is feeling the movements of the
particles outside of you.

Yeah, that I didn’t get. But I gave it a shot, doing as I
was told and feeling out the particles surrounding me. And
I found I could.

I could sense them hanging in the air, riding air currents,
moving around—all sorts of sensations.

Let’s ask the Sage about this.

Confirmed. Extra skill “Magic Sense”…successfully
acquired. Use the extra skill Magic Sense?

Yes
No

Huh? It was that easy?
Well, sure—yes, then… Man, talk about a rock I can rely
on!
The moment I invoked Magic Sense, my brain was filled
with new information. A massive amount, something my
human brain never could’ve processed—the waves of light
and sound pushing every single tiny particle around—and I
processed it all, converting it into perceptible data.
The thing about human eyesight is that it doesn’t give
you even a 180-degree view of what’s in front of you. Now,
all of a sudden, I could “see” a full 360 degrees around
myself. The shadows of the rocks around me, the views
hundreds of meters away—the moment I turned my
attention to it, I could figure out what it was. If I were still
human, all this perception data probably would’ve fried my

brain circuits. But now I was a slime. My cells could
provide muscle just as easily as brain power.

So somehow or other, I withstood the torrent of
information. Then—

Synchronizing extra skill Magic Sense with unique skill
Great Sage… Successful. All information will now be
managed by Great Sage.

Suddenly, my vision opened up. The brain-searing
sensation from before was gone, and then I could see—so
clearly that it was a wonder I wasn’t able to do it before.
Something told me that having the Sage at my side was
almost cheating. It wouldn’t be going too far to put it that
way. If someone else had it, I’d probably bitch that it was
against the rules. Since I had it, though… No problem.

Oh, I think I’ve got it. Thank you very much! I said,
turning my attention to the creature in front of me.

Holy crap. He really was a dragon. He was covered in
scales that shone a dark shade of black, tougher looking
than steel itself but supple and flexible. A big, evil-looking…

Gahh! You’re a dragon!!
He looked positively demonic, towering far higher than I
anticipated. My internal scream welled up, pouring out of
me, and I don’t think I could really be blamed for it.

What a surprise. I feel bad for ever thinking this guy was
pet sized. This was…for real. Absolutely no doubt.

The body, startlingly similar to a Western-style dragon’s,
shone like obsidian. There were six fingers on each “hand,”
equipped with claws that looked ready to tear through
whatever they found. The two pairs of wings on his back—
one larger than the other—came to a point at their
